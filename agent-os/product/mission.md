# Pebble Sales Hub - Product Mission

## Vision

Empower social media sales teams to accurately track performance, automate commission calculations, and streamline payout management—replacing error-prone spreadsheets with a purpose-built platform.

## Problem Statement

A startup company sells products through social media campaigns (Facebook posts, Instagram stories, live videos). As the business grew, manual tracking with Excel and paper created:

- **Inaccurate sales records** - Orders lost or miscounted across campaigns
- **Commission disputes** - Errors in calculating sales person payouts
- **Time wasted** - Hours spent reconciling spreadsheets each month
- **No visibility** - Sales persons couldn't see their own performance

## Solution

Pebble Sales Hub provides a centralized system where:

- Admins manage sales team members with configurable commission rates
- Campaigns are created for each social media post, live, or event
- Orders are recorded against campaigns with automatic commission calculation
- Commission rates are "snapshotted" at order creation for accuracy
- Sales persons view their earnings broken down by campaign and month

## Target Users
