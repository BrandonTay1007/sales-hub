# Stabilization: Campaign Commission Display

**Goal**: Display the total commission generated by each campaign in the Campaigns list table.

## Context
Currently, the campaigns table shows "Revenue" (total sales), but not the "Commission" (payout to sales person). This information is valuable for admins to see profitability and for sales persons to track earnings per campaign directly from the list view.

## Scope
1. **Frontend Only**:
    - Update `CampaignsPage.tsx`.
    - Calculate total commission for each campaign using the existing `orders` data (which is already fetched).
    - Add a "Commission" column to the table.

## Out of Scope
- Backend changes (the data is already available via orders list).
- Commission calculation logic changes.
