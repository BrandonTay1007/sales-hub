# Specification: Campaign Commission Display

## Goal
Display the total commission generated by each campaign in the Campaigns list table to provide financial visibility to Admins and Sales Persons.

## User Stories
- As an Admin, I want to see the total commission for each campaign so that I can understand the payout liabilities.
- As a Sales Person, I want to see the total commission I've earned per campaign so that I can track my performance.

## Specific Requirements

**Commission Calculation**
- Calculate total commission by summing `commissionAmount` from all orders associated with a campaign.
- Use existing client-side `orders` data (which is already filtered/accessible).

**Table Display**
- Add a new column "Commission" to the Campaigns table.
- Position the column after "Revenue".
- Display values formatted as currency (e.g., "RM 1,234.50").
- Right-align the column to match "Revenue".
- Use semibold font weight for visibility.

**Loading & Empty States**
- Update Skeleton loader to include the new column cell.
- Update "No campaigns found" row's `colSpan` to account for the new column (total columns + 1).

## Visual Design

**`src/pages/CampaignsPage.tsx` (Existing UI)**
- Match existing table style (shadcn/ui + Tailwind).
- Header: `table-header text-right`
- Cell: `table-cell text-right font-semibold text-foreground`

## Existing Code to Leverage

**`getCampaignRevenue` helper in `CampaignsPage.tsx`**
- Reuse the pattern: `orders.filter(o => o.campaignId === id).reduce(...)`.

**`orders` data query**
- Reuse the existing `useQuery` for orders; no new API call needed.

## Out of Scope
- Backend API changes (data is already provided).
- Changing commission calculation logic (only display).
- Sorting by Commission column.
