# Initialization: Refine Payouts Page Interaction

## Raw Idea (User's Exact Description)

1. Refine when clicking into campaign breakdown in @[sales-hub/src/pages/PayoutsPage.tsx] into summary of the campaign. Then see details for more orders
2. Please ensure clicking the whole box allow expand, currently my first instict is to click the word Click to see order details. But its not expanding, Only clikcing the blank area above there is working
